    <h1>Empanadas for an Emperor</h1>

    <h2>These are the best empanadas on the mainland!</h2>

    <p>Empanadas are one of my favorite dishes! It’s not as hard as you would think to make these at home. All you need is a few pantry staples to make the empanada dough and the filling can be made with whatever you have on hand! The empanada dough is similar to a pie dough. It is made with cold butter, cold water, flour and egg. It comes out perfectly flakey, crispy and golden brown! The homemade empanadas are then stuffed with ground beef, potatoes, cumin, chili powder, paprika, peas and fresh herbs. These are the best empanadas you will ever have!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter cubed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>6 oz. boiled diced potato</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno</li>
        <li>12 oz. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add flour, butter, and salt to a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Pulse a few times until the butter is the size of peas.</li>
        <li>Add egg and cold water to the food processor. Pulse just until ball of dough forms.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a flat round disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile you can get started on your filling. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add in onion and jalapeno and saute for 2-3 minutes or until softened and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and brown until no longer pink, 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in salt, chili powder, paprika and cumin.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste. Sauté for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Add in frozen peas, boiled potato, fresh parsley, and green onion.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough to ¼ inch thickness. Cut into circles about 5 inches in diameter using a ring cutter or small bowl. Alternatively divide into 12 small balls of dough and roll into individual circles.</li>
        <li>Place filling (about ¼ cup) on each circle and fold in half, crimp the edges with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add oil to a deep pan or pot so that it reaches 1 inch in depth. Heat oil to between 350 and 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>Fry in batches, 3 at a time, 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with salsa or sour cream for dipping!</li>
    </ul>
